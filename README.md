# Benchmark info

The benchmark used is a subset of the Elements of World Knowledge (EWoK) benchmark. The items tested here belong to the domain of social relations and test concepts like *friend*, *enemy*, *boss* and *subordinate*. We tested a total of 175 items, each consisting of two context sentences (C) and two target sentences (T). For the **choice** testing paradigm, where the goal is to choose between C1 and C1 given T, this item set yields 350 responses; for the **likert** and **logprobs** testing paradigms, this item set yields 700 responses (one response per C/T pair; 4 C/T pairs per item).

Items are available upon request (and not posted online in the attempt to prevent/delay benchmark contamination).
